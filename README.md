# SOC-automation-labSecurity Automation with Shuffle SOAR

### Overview:
This project showcases the implementation of security automation using Shuffle SOAR within a simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) environment. By integrating Shuffle SOAR with various security tools and technologies, this project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of automation in improving incident response capabilities.

### Goals:
Demonstrate the seamless integration of Shuffle SOAR with existing security tools.Showcase the automation of common security tasks to streamline incident response.Highlight the benefits of security automation in reducing response times and manual effort.

### Project Components:Setup SOC Automation Lab:
A virtual lab environment is set up using VMware Workstation.Security tools including Splunk (SIEM), Snort (IDS), and Carbon Black (EDR) are installed and configured.Integrate Shuffle SOAR:Shuffle SOAR is deployed within the lab environment using Docker containers.Integration plugins are configured to connect Shuffle SOAR with Splunk, Snort, and Carbon Black.
### Playbooks:
Custom playbooks are developed within Shuffle SOAR using Python scripting.Playbooks include tasks such as automated alert triaging, malware analysis, and incident response.Incident Simulations:Simulated security incidents are generated within the lab environment, including phishing attacks and malware infections.Shuffle SOAR playbooks automatically respond to these incidents by analyzing alerts, gathering additional context, and initiating response actions.
### Documentation and Reporting:
Comprehensive documentation is created outlining the setup process, playbook configurations, and integration details.Reports are generated to showcase the impact of automation on incident response metrics, including mean time to detect and mean time to respond.Presentation and Demonstration:A presentation is prepared summarizing the project objectives, methodology, and outcomes.A live demonstration is conducted to showcase the automated incident response capabilities using Shuffle SOAR.
### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the successful implementation of security automation using Shuffle SOAR within a SOC automation lab environment. By automating common security tasks and integrating with existing tools, Shuffle SOAR enhances incident response capabilities, leading to improved security posture and operational efficiency within the SOC. 
### Additional Considerations:
Playbooks are designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for easy customization and expansion to accommodate future security requirements.Compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR and PCI DSS is ensured throughout the project implementation.
